# Build instructions

The only requirements to build hUGETracker are a recent version of [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) for your platform, and [RGBDS.](https://rgbds.gbdev.io/)

```bat
:: Download this repo
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGETracker

:: Go into the project directory
cd hUGETracker

:: Let Lazarus know about the dependencies that HT uses
lazbuild --add-package-link src/rackctls/RackCtlsPkg.lpk
lazbuild --add-package-link src/bgrabitmap/bgrabitmap/bgrabitmappack.lpk

:: At this point, you'll successfully be able to build hUGETracker.
:: However, in order to run properly, it needs some extra files (SDL, halt.gb, fonts, etc)
:: so run the following script to automatically set that up. If you're on Mac or Linux,
:: you can replicate the commands in it yourself.

setup-windows.cmd

:: Now, you can either build and run hUGETracker from within Lazarus,
:: or run one of the following to just build a binary:

lazbuild hUGETracker.lpi --build-mode="Production Windows"
lazbuild hUGETracker.lpi --build-mode="Production Mac"
lazbuild hUGETracker.lpi --build-mode="Production Linux"

```
