# Effect editor

**TODO: updated screenshots**

The effect editor is a tool for creating effect values in the tracker grid.
This is especially useful for things like panning, or master volume, which operate on a bit level and may be difficult to input manually.
Open the editor by double-<kbd>left click</kbd>ing in the tracker grid, or with the <kbd>right click</kbd> menu.
