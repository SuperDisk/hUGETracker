Hi!
This is the manual to [hUGETracker](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGETracker).
I wrote this program because there wasn't a music editing tool for the Game Boy which fulfilled the following requirements:

- Has a tracker interface
- Produces small output
- ...which is usable for homebrew titles
- Is open-source

But now, there is!

I'd like to acknowledge:

1. [Christian Hackbart](https://github.com/TetrisSQC) for creating UGE, which serves as hUGETracker's emulation core;
1. [Rusty Wagner](https://github.com/D0ntPanic) for writing the sound code which was adapted for UGE;
1. [Lior "LIJI32" Halphon](https://github.com/LIJI32) for SameBoy, a super-accurate emulator which I used for debugging, and copied the LFSR code from;
1. [Declan "Dooskington" Hopkins](https://github.com/Dooskington) for [GameLad](https://github.com/Dooskington/GameLad), which I yanked the timing code from;
1. [Eldred "ISSOtm" Habert](https://github.com/ISSOtm), who helped me navigate the Game Boy's peculiarities, and for writing [an alternative sound driver](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO) for the tracker;
1. [Evelyn "Eevee" Woods](https://github.com/eevee), whose article on the Game Boy sound system was valuable in writing the music driver;
1. [B00daW](https://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/b00daw), for invaluable testing and debugging support on Linux;
1. [The folks who created RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/contributors), the assembler used for building ROMs from songs.

I hope you enjoy composing in hUGETracker, and if you make any cool songs, I'd love to hear from you and potentially include them as demo tunes that come with the tracker.

E-mail me at [yux50000@hotmail.com](mailto:yux50000@hotmail.com) and get in touch!
