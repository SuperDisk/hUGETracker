Hi!
This is the manual to [hUGETracker](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGETracker).
I wrote this program because there wasn't a music editing tool for the Game Boy which fulfilled the following requirements:

- Has a tracker interface
- Produces small output
- Is usable for homebrew titles
- Is open-source

But now there is!

I'd like to acknowledge:

1. [Christian Hackbart](https://github.com/TetrisSQC) for creating UGE, which serves as hUGETracker's emulation core;
1. [Rusty Wagner](https://github.com/D0ntPanic) for writing the sound code which was adapted for UGE;
1. [Lior "LIJI32" Halphon](https://github.com/LIJI32) for SameBoy, a super-accurate emulator which I used for debugging, and copied the LFSR code from;
1. [Tony "Toxa" Pavlov](https://github.com/untoxa), who helped work on the sound driver and did super valuable work on integration with GBDK
1. [Eldred "ISSOtm" Habert](https://github.com/ISSOtm), who helped me navigate the Game Boy's peculiarities, and for writing [an alternative sound driver](https://github.com/ISSOtm/fortISSimO) for the tracker;
1. [Michael "Calindro" Stegmaier](https://github.com/Calindro) for Emulicious, a super-accurate emulator that is invaluable for debugging
1. [Evelyn "Eevee" Woods](https://github.com/eevee), whose article on the Game Boy sound system was valuable in writing the music driver;
1. [B00daW](https://battleofthebits.org/barracks/Profile/b00daw), for testing and debugging support on Linux;
1. [The folks who created RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/contributors), the assembler used for building ROMs from songs.

I hope you enjoy composing in hUGETracker, and if you make any cool songs, I'd love to hear from you and potentially include them as demo tunes that come with the tracker.
